- Real-time communication and interactive learning experiences
- Efficient data management for large-scale educational data
- Optimized system performance and state management

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- MERN Stack:
  - MongoDB
  - Express.js
  - React
  - Node.js
- Next.js 13
- RTK Query
- Socket.io
- Redis

## Accomplishments

1. Engineered an industrial-level LMS using advanced web technologies, significantly enhancing scalability and real-time functionality.
2. Implemented dynamic course delivery and real-time communication features using Socket.io, improving user engagement and facilitating seamless interactive learning experiences.
3. Optimized data management and system performance by leveraging MongoDB, Redis, and RTK Query, resulting in efficient handling of large-scale educational data and streamlined state management.

## Getting Started

(Include instructions on how to set up and run the project locally)

## NPM Scripts

Here are the main npm scripts you can use to run, test, and build the project:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint",
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "server": "node server/index.js",
  "dev:server": "nodemon server/index.js",
  "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
}
```

To use these scripts, run `npm run <script-name>` or `yarn <script-name>` in the terminal. For example:

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the application for production
- `npm run start` or `yarn start`: Starts the production server
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Runs the linter to check for code style issues
- `npm run test` or `yarn test`: Runs the test suite
- `npm run server` or `yarn server`: Starts the backend server
- `npm run typecheck` or `yarn typecheck`: Runs TypeScript compiler to check for type errors
